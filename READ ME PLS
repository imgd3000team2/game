Added attack animation, simple 5 frame animation of the ninja swinging the sword. 
I will work on getting a jump and idle animation working by next class

Also, I will look up some audio for us to use and have a zip file ready.
I won't be here during the day tomorrow so if you guys want to meet up it will have to be later in the day.
